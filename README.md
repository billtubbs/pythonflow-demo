# pythonflow-demo
Trying out different tools for building a computation graph and managing dependencies.

Otherwise known as [dataflow programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming), this is a different programming paradigm to the way most languages are built.  

Quote from wikipedia.org:

> In computer programming, dataflow programming is a programming paradigm that models a program as a directed graph of the data flowing between operations, thus implementing dataflow principles and architecture.

See this question I posted on stackoverflow in August 2019 looking for Python-based solutions:

- [Best way to 'intelligently' reset memoized property values in Python when dependencies change
](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57439169/best-way-to-intelligently-reset-memoized-property-values-in-python-when-depend/57779847#57779847)

Other possible solutions:

- [Dask](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/)
- d6tflow
- Apache Airflow
- GNU Make for Data Analysis Workflow Management (https://joongsup.rbind.io/post/2018/08/26/gnu-make-for-workflow-manager/)
- Snakemake (https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
